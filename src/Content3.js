Cultural and Traditional Practices in Farming:</b><br />Indian agriculture is deeply rooted in rich cultural and traditional practices that have been passed down through generations. From rituals and ceremonies associated with planting and harvesting to folk songs and dances celebrating agricultural festivals, these traditions reflect the close relationship between farmers and the land. Moreover, indigenous farming methods such as mixed cropping, crop rotation, and organic farming are integral to preserving soil fertility and biodiversity while ensuring sustainable food production. Despite the advent of modern agricultural techniques, these cultural practices continue to shape the identity and resilience of Indian farmers, fostering a deep sense of connection to their heritage and the natural world.</p>
